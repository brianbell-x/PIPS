# Prompt Injection Prevention System (PIPS)

## Overview

The **Prompt Injection Prevention System (PIPS)** is designed to safeguard AI models against prompt injection attacks. By meticulously analyzing incoming prompts and leveraging advanced detection mechanisms, PIPS ensures that malicious attempts to manipulate the system are effectively identified and blocked, maintaining the integrity and reliability of your AI applications.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Protection**: PIPS inspects each incoming prompt along with the conversation history to detect and prevent any malicious instructions or injection attempts.
  
- **Advanced Detection Criteria**: Utilizes sophisticated analysis parameters to evaluate prompts based on factors such as instruction overrides, malicious intent, sensitive information extraction, unauthorized access attempts, and obfuscation techniques.

- **Dynamic Response Mechanism**: Depending on the severity of the detected threat, PIPS instructs the main AI model to respond appropriately, ranging from polite refusals to more stringent rejections.

- **Continuous Learning and Updating**: Regularly updates detection patterns and mitigation strategies in real-time to counter evolving adversarial attacks, ensuring ongoing protection without compromising performance.

- **Independent Operation**: Functions as a separate layer from the main AI model, providing additional security without interfering with the model's primary functionalities.

- **Transparency and Privacy**: Maintains user privacy by not exposing sensitive information or the specifics of detected injection attempts, ensuring a secure and confidential environment.

- **Developer-Friendly Configuration**: Easily configurable system prompts and detection parameters allow for seamless integration and customization based on specific requirements.
