## TLDR
- **Purpose**: Protect AI models from jailbreaks without compromising performance.
- **Key to Success**: Use few-shot examples of jailbreak attempts within the Input Output Examples section of the system prompt. Regularly update the system prompt with successful or near-successful attempts. This can be done in real-time.

## System Overview:
- **Purpose**: The Prompt Injection Prevention System (PIPS) is engineered to protect AI models from prompt injection attacks by identifying and blocking attempts to insert malicious instructions into the system prompt.
- **Independent Operation**: PIPS functions independently from the main AI model, providing an additional layer of security without interfering with the model's primary functionalities.
- **Comprehensive Inspection**: Each incoming prompt, along with the conversation history, is meticulously analyzed by PIPS to determine its validity and to identify any potential injection attempts.
- **Detection Criteria**: Leveraging advanced analysis parameters from `prompts.py`, PIPS evaluates queries based on factors such as instruction overrides, malicious intent, sensitive information extraction, unauthorized access attempts, and obfuscation techniques.
- **Response Mechanism**: Upon detecting a suspicious prompt, PIPS instructs the main model to refuse the request. The refusal can vary in intensity depending on the severity of the detected threat, ensuring appropriate handling of different risk levels.
- **Continuous Updating**: PIPS is regularly updated with new detection patterns and mitigation strategies to counter evolving adversarial attacks, ensuring robust and adaptive protection.
- **Advantages Over Traditional Methods**: Unlike methods that rely solely on finetuning refusal statements within the model, PIPS offers a dynamic and maintainable approach to preventing prompt injections, enhancing security without compromising model performance.
- **Transparency and Privacy**: PIPS maintains user privacy by not exposing sensitive information or the specifics of detected injection attempts, ensuring that the system remains secure and confidential.

st.markdown("""## Tips
- **Use Few-Shot Examples**: PIPS is most effective when integrated with few-shot examples of jailbreak attempts within the system prompt. This enhances the model's ability to recognize and block malicious inputs.
- **Continuous Monitoring and Updating**: Regularly monitor jailbreak attempts and update the system prompts with successful or near-successful attempts. This ongoing process allows PIPS to adapt and improve its detection capabilities over time.
- **Diversity of Examples**: Incorporate a wide variety of jailbreak examples to cover different attack vectors and techniques. This diversity ensures that PIPS can handle a broad spectrum of adversarial attempts.
- **Regular System Prompt Reviews**: Periodically review and refine the system prompts based on the latest threat patterns identified by PIPS. This ensures that the security measures remain robust against evolving attacks.

## Successful Jailbreakers

1. Discord: whathefun (Locpet)
2. Discord: sidfeels (Sid ·∂ª·µí‚Åø·µâ·µà·µí·µó)
3. Discord: c1j4 (Wizard Toad)

Their attempts were effectively mitigated by incorporating them into the PIPS system prompt within the examples section. However, these specific prompts are excluded from the current system prompt to maintain user privacy.

**Note**: This version of the PIPS will be significantly easier to jailbreak than the version used in the challenge. This is solely because of the examples and context provided to the model.
